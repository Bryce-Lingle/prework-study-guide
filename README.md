# The Start to My Coding Career

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation for creating this webpage was to make a public note guide to the prework at UC Berkeley. It allowed me to take notes as I progressed through the course. 
- I built this project to practice my skills and put the knowledged that I learned into practice. This allowed me to problem solve and practice. 
- This solved the problem of - how will I hold onto the prework study guide notes, and also answered my question of "How will I practice this as I go through the course?" What better way to learn code, than to actually practice coding? 
- While some of the topics introduced in this prework module were hard to grasp, I learned a lot. I began owkring on the foundational skills of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and Git.
